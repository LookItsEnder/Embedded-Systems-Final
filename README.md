  <h1>Robotic Arm</h1>
  <section>
    <p>For an Embedded Systems class taken at UW-Whitewater, Spring 2024:</p>
    <p>This robotic arm functions similar to a CNC machine, where two motors rotate threaded rods like a gantry system. A servo is attached to a placement on one of the axis rods, and is used to lift and lower a pen for drawing. All of this is controled through the use of a Joystick Module</p>
    <p>Modules used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arduino Uno R3</li>
      <li>L298N Motor Driver Module</li>
      <li>SG90 Servo</li>
      <li>Performance Slot Car Motors</li>
      <li>Joystick Module</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note, this is <b>MY</b> code, if you have a similar school project, use this only as a reference as to how certain modules work, instead of copying my work straight up.</p>
